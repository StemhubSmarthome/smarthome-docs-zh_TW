![](picture/10/10_1.png)

## 10.1 Goal 
<P>
Make a smart traffic light system which automatically switches between red and green lights among different intersection traffic lights according to the road traffic situation. 
<P>

## 10.2 Background
### What is a smart traffic light? 
<P>
Smart traffic light systems are designed to maintain normal operation of the intersection. They automatically switch between red and green lights among different intersection traffic lights according to the road traffic situation.   
<P>

## 10.6 Programming (MakeCode) 
### Traffic light 1：
### Step 1. Set up a new function (TurnRed) 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light yellow on 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light red on 
  
![](picture/10/10_12.png)


### Step 2. Set up a new function (TurnGreen) 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light yellow on 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light green on 
  
![](picture/10/10_14.png)


### Step 3. Initialize the program 
+ Drag set variable trafficLight to Traffic light pin setting Red P0 Yellow P1 Green P2 to on start 
+ Drag radio set group 10 to on start   
+ Control traffic light red on 
+ Pause for 5s 
  
![](picture/10/10_16.png)

### Step 4. Keep the green light status for 5 second 
+ Call function TurnGreen 
+ Pause 1.5s before TurnGreen 
+ Pause 3.5s after TurnGreen 
  
![](picture/10/10_17.png)


### Step 5. Keep the red light status for 5 second 
+ Call function TurnRed
+ set variable second to 50 
+ While second > 0, snap pause to 0.1 second and change second by -1.

### Step 6. Get distance value
+ Snap if statement into while loop, set get distance unit cm trig P15 echo P16 < 20

  
![](picture/10/10_21.png)


### Step 7. Control traffic light 2 and car by sending radio number
+ Drag radio send number 1 into if 
+ Drag radio send number 0 after TurnGreen 
+ Drag radio send string “R”  before TurnGreen 
+ Drag radio send string “G” before TurnRed

### Traffic light 2：
### Step 1. Set up new functions 
  
![](picture/10/10_25.png)


### Step 2. Initialize the program
+ Drag set variable trafficLight to Traffic light pin setting Red P0 Yellow P1 Green P2 to on start 
+ Drag radio set group 10 to on start   
+ Control traffic light green on 
+ Pause for 5s 
  
![](picture/10/10_27.png)


### Step 3. Control traffic light and car by receiving different number 
+ Snap if statement into on radio received receivedString 
+ Set receivedString =“R” and call TurnRed 
+ Set receivedString =“G” and call TurnGreen 
  
![](picture/10/10_29.png)

## 10.7 Result 
<P>
Distance sensor is used to detect whether there are cars passing by. If it is yes (i.e., there are cars passing by in the intersection), it sends a signal to the cars in the corresponding direction and alerts them to stop, in order to maintain a normal traffic flow of the intersection. 
<P>


## 10.8 Think 
<P>
Challenge question: 
<P>
<P>
In case that it is a intersecion, there should be four traffic lights for four different directions. Can you write a program in that case?
<P>
