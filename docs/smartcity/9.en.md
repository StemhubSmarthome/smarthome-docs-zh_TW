# Lesson 09: Smart Pedestrian Lights 2 
![](picture/9/9_1.png)

## 9.1 Goal 
<P>
Make a smart pedestrian light system with an alerting sound on the basis of the last lesson. 
<P>


## 9.2 Background 
### What is a smart pedestrian light? 
<P>
Smart pedestrian light systems are designed to maintain normal operation of the intersection. They automatically switch between red and green lights among different intersection traffic lights according to the road traffic situation.    
<P>

## 9.6 Programming (MakeCode) 
### Traffic light 1：
### Step 1. Set up a new function (TurnRed) 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light yellow on 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light red on 
 
![](picture/9/9_12.png)


### Step 2. Set up a new function (TurnGreen) 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light yellow on 
+ Snap pause to wait 1 second 
+ Control traffic light green on 
 
![](picture/9/9_14.png)


### Step 3. Initialize the program 
+ Drag set variable trafficLight to Traffic light pin setting Red P0 Yellow P1 Green P2 to on start 
+ Control traffic light green on 
+ Drag radio set group 6 to on start   
+ In forever, snap function TurnRed into if get motion (triggered or not) at pin P4 case 
+ Drag function TurnGreen after the while loop

### Step 4. Control traffic light 2 by sending radio string
+ Drag radio send string “R”  before TurnGreen 
+ Drag radio send string “G” after TurnRed

### Traffic light 2：
### Step 1. Set up new functions  
 
![](picture/9/9_22.png)


### Step 2. Initialize the program
+ Drag set variable trafficLight to Traffic light pin setting Red P0 Yellow P1 Green P2 to on start 
+ Drag radio set group 6 to on start   
+ Control traffic light green on 
+ Set a variable green=0 
 
![](picture/9/9_24.png)


### Step 3. Control traffic light by receiving different number 
+ Snap if statement into on radio received receivedString 
+ Set receivedString =“R” and call TurnRed 
+ Set receivedString =“G” and call TurnGreen 
+ Change variable green depend on the light

### Step 4. Play sound effect depend on the light status 
+ Snap if statement into forever 
+ Play melody with different tempo

### Receiver：
### Step 1. Set radio set group at start position 
+ Drag radio set group 6 to on start  
+ Initially, the car  moves forward by default

### Step 2. Control car by receiving different number 
+ Snap if statement into on radio received receivedNumber 
+ Set receivedNumber =1 and make the car stop 
+ Set receivedNumber=0 and make the car move forward

## 9.7 Result 
<P>
On the basis of the last lesson, a smart pedestrian light system with an alerting sound is added in this lesson. 
<P>


## 9.8 Think 
<P>
Try to let the green light blink before turning green, and match with a suitable sound effect.
