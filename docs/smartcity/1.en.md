# Lesson 01: Automated Smart Street Lamp
![](picture/1/1_1.png)
 
## 1.1 Goal
<P>
Make a smart street lamp which can automatically turn on when it is getting dark or senses a car coming from afar.
<P>

## 1.2 Background

### What is a smart street lamp?
<P>
Smart street lamp is a lamp which can open automatically when it senses a car coming from afar. Installing an auto-light can help the earth save electricity. When no car passes by, the light will automatically turn off.
<P>

### Smart street lamp operation
<P>
Light sensors should be able to detect the environmental brightness and obstacle Infrared avoidance sensor should be able to detect if there is a car coming. If it is getting dark and there is a car coming from afar, the LED light should turn on, vice versa.

## 1.6. Programming (MakeCode) 

### Step 1. Disable micro:bit LED. 
 
+ Snap led enable false to on start  
+ Note that P3 is used as LED in default setting, LED need to be disable

### Step 2. Turn on LED by light sensor and obstacle Infrared avoidance sensor
+ Drag forever from Basic
+ Snap if statement into forever
+ Set get light value (percentage) at P1 <40  and get motion (triggered or not) at P0 = true, into if statement that says motion is triggered, someone passes by.
+ Then, turn white LED to 1023 at P2 as turning on white LED and pause 10 seconds. 
+ Else, turn white LED at P2 to 0 as turning off.

## 1.7 Result
<P>
An obstacle Infrared avoidance sensor is used to detect the motion of a car. If there is, the LED light will be turned on; otherwise, it will be turned off.
<P>

## 1.8 Think 
<P>
Q1. How can you use the obstacle Infrared avoidance sensor, other than turning on the light automatically?
